## Overview

Rapidora is an incredibly sophisticated graphical installer (Fork) that gets a fresh Fedora install ready in minutes. It features a fully rewritten UI using a modern, animated "Card-based" Dark Mode with Glow effects, driven by an asynchronous QProcess backend in C++ and Qt6. Choose exactly what you want from a curated repository encompassing Gaming, Multimedia, AI Development Ecosystems, Browsers with PGP injections, and significantly more.

- Written from scratch with a luxurious, animated, and responsive interface.
- No terminal needed if you use the pre-built RPM packages from Releases.
- Isolated tools verified dynamically on boot (RPM vs Flatpaks).
- Fully asynchronous smart-threading architecture ensuring zero UI stutter!
- This repository is an **Elevated Fork** actively maintained by **Diogo Travassos**, building upon the foundational framework originally envisioned by the *LinuxGamerLife* YouTube channel.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Fedora 43+ (developed and tested on Fedora 43) |

## Installation

### No terminal
Download the RPM in releases and run it. It will open in Discover, click install at the top and enter your password. Once installed, there will be a new icon in Utilities



After installation the app appears in your KDE launcher under **Utilities** as **Rapidora**. Launch it and a single password prompt will appear — the wizard then runs fully elevated.


> **Note — Qt version compatibility:** Always build the binary on the same machine you intend to run it on, or on a machine with the same Qt6 version. A binary built against Qt 6.10 will not run on a system with an older Qt6 installed (`version 'Qt_6.10' not found`). If you see this error, either build from source on the target machine or update Qt6 first:
> ```bash
> sudo dnf upgrade qt6-qtbase
> ```
